<p>'Last Men Standing'</p>
<p>In March, The Chronicle published <a href="http://projects.sfchronicle.com/2016/living-with-aids/" target="_blank">“Last Men Standing,”</a> an in-depth look at the issues facing longtime survivors of HIV and AIDS through the lives of eight Bay Area men. It was a yearlong reporting effort that also produced a <a href="http://projects.sfchronicle.com/2016/living-with-aids/documentary/" target="_blank">feature-length documentary</a> that has been screened at 10 film festivals across the nation and internationally.</p>
<p>Here, we present an update on those men, on the impacts of the “Last Men Standing” project, and on what has changed – and what hasn’t – in public awareness and the response to the plight of those aging with HIV and AIDS. Read about the <a href="http://projects.sfchronicle.com/2016/profiles/" target="_blank">men's journeys</a> since the project's debut, and revisit the <a href="http://projects.sfchronicle.com/2016/living-with-aids/" target="_blank">original project</a>.</p>
