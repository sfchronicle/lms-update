<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>esus Guillen pushed his way through the bustling exhibition hall, past the drug company handing out gummy candies and the HIV awareness group planting smiley-face stickers on everyone’s name badges.</p>

<p>“Mija,” he said, tugging a reporter toward a man in a white lab coat. “Come here. This doctor is the one you need to meet.”</p>

<p>Jesus, 56, was on the prowl at the United States Conference on AIDS in September, working the room like a traveling salesman or talent scout. The gathering north of Miami offered a wealth of potential allies in his work fighting for long-term survivors of AIDS.</p>

<p>That night, Jesus attended a screening of “Last Men Standing,” a documentary featuring him and other survivors. He had changed from casual beachwear to flowing black pants laced up the sides, over a flashy pair of beat-up black boots. He was exuberant. During a question-and-answer panel after the film, he ran into the audience to hug a woman who cried while relating her own story of survival.</p>

<p>Returning to San Francisco, Jesus made plans to reconnect with his Florida contacts. But barely a month later, he was in so much pain he could barely walk. He limped out of a doctor’s office, leaning on a cane like it was the only thing keeping him upright.</p>

<p>“Mija,” he said, his voice a hollow croak. “I need to go to the hospital now.”</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>esus is one face of AIDS survival. Diagnosed with HIV in 1986, he is one of roughly 6,000 gay men in San Francisco who were infected with the virus before treatments were discovered, back when HIV was almost always a death sentence. They outlived the epidemic, only to find themselves in a lasting struggle with unexpected, and sometimes debilitating, consequences of survival.</p>

<p>Early this year, Jesus was one of eight men profiled by The Chronicle in “Last Men Standing” — a reporting project on aging survivors of HIV and AIDS that included the feature-length documentary. Of those eight survivors, one died before his story could be published.</p>

<p>In the months since, the other seven men have mostly thrived, though some more than others. They have all, at times, continued to languish. Three have moved, or are about to move, into new homes. Two have experienced serious medical problems. One has a new job. One continues to suffer severe depression. Their chronic battles — and their joys and griefs — reflect the seemingly endless struggle of their generation.</p>

<p>Jesus found strength in his new spotlight. Long a tireless, if relatively quiet, advocate for his peers, he sought to draw attention to the unique needs of long-term survivors, who’d felt forgotten as HIV became a treatable condition, and the urgency of the AIDS epidemic faded.</p>

<p>Many survivors continue to face serious health risks, either from the infection or their protracted use of the medications to treat the virus. Others are struggling with mental health issues. Some live in severe isolation, or with depression and anxiety. Financial troubles are widespread.</p>

<p>Jesus’ recent illness, from which he’s only just starting to recover, shook him badly. At the same time, it sharpened his focus on how much work must still be done to bring critical services to long-term survivors.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to die. But I don’t know how long I have,” Jesus said one recent afternoon, sitting cross-legged on his bed in his Hayes Valley apartment. His cat, called Mija like the nickname he gives to friends, patrolled his bedroom, pacing the perimeter before allowing Jesus to pet her.</p>

<p>“One thing I got from this,” he said, “is I don’t have time to play nice and kiss ass.”</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the Bay Area and beyond, the survivor community has blossomed over the past year, in particular gay men now in their 50s and 60s who were infected during the worst years of the AIDS epidemic.</p>

<p>At public screenings of the “Last Men Standing” documentary — in San Francisco, New York, Chicago, Portland, Ore., and a dozen other cities — survivors often stood at the end of the film to share their own stories. They came up to Jesus or one of the other men who were featured to say that now, finally, they didn’t feel so alone.</p>

<p>Many wanted to know what’s being done to help them.</p>

<p>But even in San Francisco — long considered among the best providers of HIV care in the world — the demands of long-term survivors remain mostly unmet. After The Chronicle published its story, then-Supervisor Scott Wiener asked an HIV planning group to submit a formal request for funding for survivor services. The group requested nearly $2 million for programs, including housing aid, mental health services, job training and food resources.</p>

<p>So far, though, only $150,000 for a needs assessment survey of older people with HIV has been promised by the city. The survey is set to launch in February.</p>

<p>A measure passed by San Francisco voters in November could be another source of funding. It set aside $38 million for a “dignity fund” to support programs for seniors and disabled adults. Long-term survivor groups are hoping to obtain some of that money for their needs.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the survivor community has been taking care of its own, in particular through efforts to build up social support.</p>

<p>Jesus had started a Facebook group for survivors in summer 2015, and it now has more than 3,500 members. The Elizabeth Taylor 50-Plus Network, an informal support group run by the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, has seen attendance at its weekly meetings explode; 90 people attended its annual Thanksgiving dinner, three times as many as the first holiday gathering two years ago.</p>

<p>“Over the span of this year so much has happened, especially in the Bay Area,” said Matt Sharp, a long-term survivor who has worked for various AIDS agencies since the beginning of the epidemic, and who this month published a report online on the “unintended consequences” of surviving AIDS.</p>

<p>“We’ve made a lot of progress,” Sharp said. “It’s actually a good time for us in San Francisco. We just have to keep the momentum going.”</p>

<p>His paper, funded by drug company Bristol-Meyers Squibb, is meant as a road map for identifying survivors and providing them services. Like The Chronicle’s report, Sharp found that treatment and support are critically needed for post-traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, isolation and, in some cases, drug and alcohol abuse. Severe health risks — like cancer, diabetes and secondary infections — may also be tied to long-term exposure to HIV.</p>

<p>One theme of Sharp’s paper is how little is understood about long-term survivors. It’s not known how many there are in the United States, or the extent of their mental and physical health needs. Estimates of post-traumatic stress disorder rates, for example, range widely, he said. Clearly, Sharp wrote, “more intensive research needs to be done.”</p>

<p>That’s where the city-funded needs assessment survey could be pivotal, said Vince Crisostomo, a long-term survivor who runs the 50-Plus Network.</p>

<p>“I’ve spent my entire adult life being hopeful — hopeful they’d find a cure, hopeful they’d save my friends, hopeful my friends would live longer,” Crisostomo said. “That hasn’t changed.”</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">J</span>esus typically would share Sharp and Crisostomo’s optimism. He is a man with a personality as sunny and flamboyant as his wardrobe and dyed blond hair.</p>

<p>But lately he’s struggled with unusual bouts of despair. Some of his mood traces to his recent illness, which reminded him of his enduring frailty. Witnessing the prodigious amount of work that remains in drawing attention to his community of survivors was also, at times, disheartening.</p>

<p>On the Facebook group he founded, he sees men and women reaching out to each other — glad for the support, but still feeling alone, abandoned and afraid for their futures.</p>

<p>In July, Jesus went to the International AIDS Conference in South Africa, invited to represent “Last Men Standing” at a film screening. He thrilled at the opportunity. But though he had a positive experience, and was warmly received, he was distressed by the overall lack of conversation about survivors at the conference.</p>

<p>Jesus, and the film, were the only nods to long-term survivors. Not a single lecture was devoted to the topic, he said. The event was focused on prevention, treatment, vaccine and cure research, and access to care.</p>

<p>Those are critical fields for the global epidemic, Jesus knows. But in the United States, at least, people age 50 and over — many of them infected for two or more decades — make up the bulk of all people with HIV. Yet they get so little attention.</p>

<p>“Many of the problems we’re having now are because we were not prepared,” Jesus said. “We never thought we’d get here.”</p>

<p>Isn’t ignoring these problems now, he asked, just repeating the same mistakes?</p>

<p>Still, he returned from South Africa ready to keep fighting. At all hours, he’d post on his Facebook group or send messages to friends. “Our actions can have so much input in other peoples’ lives,” he wrote one night in August. “How much wood we put into the fire, it is up to us. But at least we try.”</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">H</span>e was still crusading a month later at the AIDS conference in Florida, though his energy was beginning to wane. Maybe the illness had started by then. He’d thought he was just rundown from all the travel.</p>

<p>He had big plans: to attend a screening of “Last Men Standing” in New York, and maybe another in Spain. But the sickness came on quickly. By Oct. 20, the day he finally went to the hospital, his pain was so bad that it was “untouchable” by the strongest drugs he had on hand for his neuropathy. He couldn’t sleep. He would feel so ill that he’d vomit.</p>

<p>He missed the New York screening. He missed a dance held for long-term survivors in the Mission District. He missed a meeting to discuss the San Francisco needs assessment survey that he’d helped secure the funding for.</p>

<p>He was so weak he couldn’t talk on the phone, couldn’t email or even go online. He stopped visiting his Facebook group. It was too much work, and he was so tired.</p>

<p>Doctors still don’t know what caused his illness, though they believe it was a particularly stubborn bacterial infection. They also don’t know why, over the summer, Jesus had a brief bout of Kaposi sarcoma — the disfiguring cancer that notoriously afflicts people with AIDS.</p>

<p>His HIV infection is under control, and yet Jesus is still scarily, frustratingly vulnerable.</p>

<p>Being so sick put his life, and his commitments, into stark perspective. He learned, for instance, that sometimes he has to back off and take care of himself — that there are others who will pick up his work when he is unable. That’s a relief, but also a disappointment, he admits.</p>

<p>“I was very happy the Facebook group was going on without me,” Jesus said. “But at the same time, it was like, ‘Wait, the group can go on without me?’”</p>

<p>He’s rebounding now. He spent a weekend this month at a retreat for HIV survivors in Lake County. He’s back on Facebook. But he also recognizes that maybe it’s OK, sometimes, to let go.</p>

<p>“I do feel a lot of obligation and responsibility, and it’s too much sometimes. It’s like I have a Jesus complex,” he said with a soft laugh.</p>

<p>“Honestly,” he added, “I already feel like I’ve left my little grain of sand on the Earth.”</p>
