<p>Sitting on their sofa, David Spiher and Ralph Thurlow ignored the cats chasing each other under the coffee table and around their legs.</p>

<p>David watched, his face unreadable, as Ralph talked about “Walter,” the man Ralph believes lives across the street from the couple in Hayward. The man he believes is the adult son he abandoned.</p>

<p>“I should knock on the door,” Ralph said, beginning to stand, “and see if he needs anything.”</p>

<p>David shook his head, smiling a little — because how else could he react? Walter doesn’t exist. Ralph never abandoned a son. Walter is an invention of Ralph’s dementia.</p>

<p>“No,” David said, gently. “Let’s not do that.”</p>

<p>Ralph, 57, and David, 58, are both HIV-positive — Ralph since 2004, David since 1985. For many years they were relatively healthy, with good careers and a new house in Hayward, and they imagined a long, peaceful future together.</p>

<p>Then Ralph was diagnosed with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. It’s a condition with similarities to Alzheimer’s disease and is ultimately fatal.</p>

<p>For a while, Ralph’s symptoms were mild: He sometimes fumbled for words, or got dates and places wrong, but unless you knew him well you might not notice anything was amiss.</p>

<p>That changed when David realized one day in March that Ralph had been hearing voices, perhaps for months. The voices were scaring Ralph — saying cruel things about him or telling him awful stories about the people around him.</p>

<p>Doctors put Ralph on antipsychotic drugs, but they made him dopey and vague. It was only in September, after the voices got so bad that David was forced to hospitalize Ralph, that they got his meds adjusted.</p>

<p>Since then, the delusions have continued, but they aren’t as upsetting. And Ralph is mostly back to his wry, conversational self.</p>

<p>Still, his outlook remains grim. At a recent appointment, a neurologist told David that Ralph was in the later stages of his illness. It wasn’t the hallucinations that bothered the doctor, but that he had trouble dressing himself — putting his shirts on inside out, or his pajamas over his pants.</p>

<p>Eventually, Ralph will have trouble feeding himself and walking. He’ll struggle with swallowing and start to choke. People with dementia don’t die from the cognitive decline, but from pneumonia or asphyxiation.</p>

<p>David keeps a stack of papers on their kitchen table. They’re all images of clocks that Ralph has drawn — a standard diagnostic tool for people with dementia. In the early stages, patients will know to draw a circle for a face, and numbers in some order, with hands pointing to the time. In Ralph’s drawings, sometimes the numbers are all lumped to one side, or floating in space with no circle at all.</p>

<p>People sometimes tell David he should live in the moment. “Meet Ralph where he’s at,” they say. David looks at the clocks. “But where is he?”</p>

<p>He’s started incorporating Ralph’s clocks into his art — his paintings of Ralph or of the two of them. As David sifted through his recent works one day, Ralph sat quietly on the couch, watching.</p>

<p>He said, when asked, that he likes participating in David’s art. “It’s fine,” he said.</p>

<p>And then, unprompted, he went on.</p>

<p>“I just don’t want to take up too much time,” Ralph said. “You’re always losing time.”</p>
