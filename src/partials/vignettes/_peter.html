<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>eter Greene died 10 months ago, but Eileen Glutzer sees him, in one way or another, every day.</p>

<p>She’ll find an old coat he left behind in her closet, or a pair of his boots. There are photos, of course. And the ceramic mugs he painted for her every Christmas — she has a shelf full of them.</p>

<p>“Death puts things in perspective,” Eileen said, sitting in her sunny living room in Noe Valley. “You don’t realize what matters until someone’s gone.”</p>

<p>Eileen, 68, was first Peter’s nurse, not long after he was diagnosed with HIV in 1985. Then she was his friend, and finally, his family.</p>

<p>In the end, she was the one who inherited almost everything: his scrapbooks and photos, his framed posters and paintings, his mobile home in Palm Springs, where he’d lived since his rental apartment in San Francisco was sold and he was forced to leave the city he loved.</p>

<p>Eileen was the one who spread Peter’s ashes in July, near a favorite camping spot in the Gold Country.</p>

<p>Peter died suddenly of liver failure on Feb. 10. The last time Eileen saw him, he was staying in her home while he visited San Francisco. They had a bad fight — the kind of dumb argument that old friends get into sometimes and usually resolves itself after a few days’ silence. Peter left without saying goodbye.</p>

<p>She managed to talk to him one more time, while he was in a hospital in Palm Springs. She told him she was on her way down. She told him she’d be there. She didn’t make it in time.</p>

<p>Eileen lost so many people during the worst years of the AIDS epidemic. Patients who’d become friends, or friends who’d become patients. But Peter was special. Peter was family.</p>

<p>“I always knew Peter was going to die, too,” she said, “and then one day, he did.”</p>

<p>She still talks to him, out loud in her home. Some mornings she’ll sing, reminded of the show tunes they’d belt out together over breakfast.</p>

<p>One day she was in her garden, and came across a flower she’d never seen. And she knew, without thinking, who had planted the bulb months before.</p>

<p>“Hi, Peter,” she said. “It’s so beautiful. Thank you.”</p>
